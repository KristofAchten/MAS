TODO:
	K + M - Testing
	K - Delivery time for users	-ALL DEADLINES (except for full research): 27/5: 23u59
	K - Optimal user pickup (+^)
	M - Research

Research questions:
	OBJECTIVE: 	- Compare the performances of a basic FCFS task planning algorithm against a more sophisticated one with optimal task allocation.
			- Present our findings during the feedback sessions on the 13th of June.
	QUESTIONS: 	- Does the sophisticated approach, on average, deliver more users on time than the FCFS approach?
			- Does a higher user arrival rate change this? (building on the result of ^)?
			- When deliveries occur after the parcel deadline has expired, what is the average delay for the sophisticated approach compared to the FCFS approach?
	HYPOTHESES: 	- FCFS task planning will deliver less users on time when the arrival rate of users increases.
			- When the arrival rate of users is low, both methods will give similar performance.
			- The delays measured with FCFS task planning will be higher than the ones measured with the sophisticated approach.
	VARIABLES:	- INDEPENDENT: User arrival rate {DOUBLE: 0 - 1 / tick}, Task planning algorithm {METHOD: FCFS, Sophisticated}
			- DEPENDENT: Number of timely deliveries, delay.
			- Number of pods, Number of loading-docks, graph model, speed, reservation timings
